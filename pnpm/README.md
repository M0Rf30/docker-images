# How to use this image

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your Node.js app project

```dockerfile
# specify the base image with your desired version
FROM guergeiro/pnpm:22-10
COPY . .
RUN pnpm install
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-nodejs-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-nodejs-app
```

# Image Variants

## `guergeiro/pnpm:<node-version>-<pnpm-version>`

This is the defacto image.

## `guergeiro/pnpm:<node-version>-<pnpm-version>-alpine`

This image is based on the popular
[Alpine Linux project](https://alpinelinux.org/), available in
[the alpine official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine).

## `guergeiro/pnpm:<node-version>-<pnpm-version>-slim`

This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and
only contains the minimal packages needed to run `node`.

Support is given based on
[Node's release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
and the compatibility list of
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#compatibility).

**IMPORTANT:**

Special versions of node - `lts`, `latest`, `current` - will only target the
last version of pnpm.
